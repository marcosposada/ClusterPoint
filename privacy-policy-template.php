<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Chrome) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
